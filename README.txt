Used this path animation jquery module: https://github.com/weepy/jquery.path

to create a radial menu with css circles akin to a menu I liked on the Path iPhone app. 

As of now, the menu animates open and closed. All you have to do to set it up is specify the name of the <ul> tag you want turned into a radial menu, and the code will turn the elements to circles and center the text within the circle for you. It is also adaptable to any number of items, and will always space the circles evenly.

Here's the live version:
